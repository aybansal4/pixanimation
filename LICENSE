Condition: You must include the original copyright notice and license text in all copies or substantial portions.

Warranty / liability: The software is provided "as is" without warranty; authors are not liable for damages.

Note: Adding an MIT LICENSE file to your repo does not remove third‑party obligations (e.g., if you distribute binaries linked with GPL/LGPL FFmpeg builds you may still have to comply with those licenses). Consult legal counsel for redistribution questions.
