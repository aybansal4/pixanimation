Notes:
- using FFmpeg for video generation
- syntax has colors, metadata, and frame building
- builds an mp4
Syntax:
- metadata:
	- uses function-like syntax with semicolon: meta(fps=fps_value, height=height_in_pixels, width=width_in_pixels);
- frames:
	- defining a frame is with the number of frames and frame in brackets:
		1 {...(frame contents)...}
	- pixels and colors:
		-colors are R for red, O for orange, Y for yellow, G for green, B for blue, V for violet, 1 for white, and 0 for black; any 
		 others should be made with the base
		- each number/letter for colors are 1x1 out of your resolution (e.g. 125*276)
		- the video is adapted to the screen resolution but the "pixels" grow and not the video
Using the tool with a file:
 - You want to build a video with pixanimation like this:
   pixanimation myAnimation.txt -o animation.mp4
Note that if you don't specify a destination with -o, it will save the animation to out.mp4
